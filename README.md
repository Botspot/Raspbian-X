# Raspbian-X
I had a hard time finding a working Raspbian-X download link, so I'm sharing what I found:  
[Saved snapshot of raspbian-x.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20200517220148/https://raspbian-x.com/)  
[Reddit - bunch of download mirrors](https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/gjd2wf/raspbian_x_nighthawk_edition_released_pi_lab/fqk8k8u/)  
[Download link from mega](https://mega.nz/file/2Ql3QAxB#Wo3kutlE2DJ01J_gVJ9-6z4j7eqxpe_kF7b-xu8E2v4)

[Torrent for both Raspbian-X and iRaspbian](https://archive.org/details/raspbianx)  
Missing link? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Botspot/Raspbian-X/issues/new) and I'll add it.  

## iRaspbian:

PS: **Ever wanted to run a Raspbian img before flashing it to your SD card**? Introducing [Vdesktop](https://github.com/Botspot/vdesktop) - a handy terminal program that **boots Raspbian virtual machines** at *100% native speed*.  
Unlike any other program, this is the only one that *shows you the img's **graphics** & **desktop***.

I've also made a graphical version that comes with many other img manipulation tools. It's called [Pi-Power-Tools](https://github.com/Botspot/Pi-Power-Tools).
