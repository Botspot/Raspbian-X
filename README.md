PS: **Ever wanted to run a Raspbian img before flashing it to your SD card**? Introducing [Vdesktop](https://github.com/Botspot/vdesktop) - a handy terminal program that **boots Raspbian virtual machines** at *100% native speed*.  
Unlike any other program, this is the only one that *shows you the img's **graphics** & **desktop***.  
I've also made a graphical version that comes with many other img manipulation tools. It's called [Pi-Power-Tools](https://github.com/Botspot/Pi-Power-Tools).
